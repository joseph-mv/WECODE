## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joseph-mv/WECODE.git
   cd WECODE/frontend
    ```


2. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
    ```

### Running the application



1.**Start the frontend server :**
- Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and run

 ```bash
   npm run dev

```
This command starts a local development server. By default, it runs on http://localhost:5173, where you can view the application in your browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the page.
2.**Build the project for production:**

 ```bash
   npm run build

```
This command generates an optimised production build in the dist folder. The build is minified and includes all necessary assets for deployment.
